Neugs extracts the essence of your text and automatically suggests possible tags.

== Description ==

Neugs extracts the essence of your text and automatically suggests possible tags. Your blog posts are analysed by a remote intelligent engine and the results are returned to you via our API. This layout ensures smooth operation and virtually zero resource usage at the machine at which your blog is installed.

The Neugs system learns. Its accuracy increases gradually. The more you use it, the more accurate its tag suggestions become. Thank you in advance for helping us educate Neugs. Soon you will no longer have to tag anything on your own.

Neugs users can compare their blogs using an objective metric rather than relying on subjectively selected tags.
